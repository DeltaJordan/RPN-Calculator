## C++ RPN Calculator

Quick project I developed to learn C++. Uses [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
to perform mathmatical calculations.

### How to use

Available operands: Add +, Subtract -, Multiply *, Divide /, Exponential ^ or **  
Square Root: SQRT  
Clear: C  
All Clear: AC  
Example valid expression:  
```
5  
6  
+  
[returns 11, removes 5 and 6, and places 11 bottom of the stack]  
```

Note that all inputs are case-insensitive.
